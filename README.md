# Super Approach




## Build & Run

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

# build for production with minification
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
```
